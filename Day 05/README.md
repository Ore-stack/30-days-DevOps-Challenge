# NCAAGameHighlights

# HighlightProcessor
This project uses RapidAPI to fetch NCAA game highlights in a Docker container and utilizes AWS MediaConvert to convert the media files.

# File Overview

## config.py

Manages environment variables by importing and assigning values, providing defaults where needed. This enables flexible configuration for different environments like development, staging, or production without changing the source code.

## fetch.py

Defines the date and league (NCAA in this case) to retrieve highlights from the API. It stores the highlights in an S3 bucket as a JSON file (e.g., basketball_highlight.json).

## process_one_video.py 

This script retrieves the JSON file from the S3 bucket, extracts the first video URL, downloads the video, and stores it in a new S3 location (videos/). It also logs each step's status.

## mediaconvert_process.py 

Submits a job to AWS MediaConvert, processes the video (adjusting codec, resolution, bitrate, and audio settings), and saves the processed video to an S3 bucket.

## run_all.py 

Executes all scripts in order, with buffer time between tasks for proper execution.

## .env file 

Contains environment variables to avoid hardcoding sensitive data in the scripts.

## Dockerfile 

Defines the steps to build the Docker image for the project.

## Terraform Scripts
Automate the creation of AWS resources (e.g., S3, IAM roles, ECS, ECR) in a scalable and repeatable manner.

## Prerequisites
Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following:

## **1** Create Rapidapi Account
Sign up for a RapidAPI account to access the Sports Highlights API. For this project, NCAA (USA College Basketball) highlights are used, which are included in the free plan.

[Sports Highlights API](https://rapidapi.com/highlightly-api-highlightly-api-default/api/sport-highlights-api/playground/apiendpoint_16dd5813-39c6-43f0-aebe-11f891fe5149) is the endpoint to use.

## **2** Verify prerequites are installed 

Docker should be pre-installed in most regions docker --version

AWS CloudShell has AWS CLI pre-installed aws --version

Python3 should be pre-installed also python3 --version

## **3** Retrieve AWS Account ID

Log into the AWS Management Console, click on your account name at the top right, and copy the Account ID for later use.

## **4** Retrieve Access Keys and Secret Access Keys
In the IAM dashboard, check if you have an access key. If not, create a new access key under "Security Credentials".

# START HERE - Local
## **Step 1: Clone The Repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ore-stack/30-days-DevOps-Challenge.git
cd src
```
## **Step 2: Add API Key to AWS Secrets Manager**
```bash
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
    --name my-api-key \
    --description "API key for accessing the Sport Highlights API" \
    --secret-string '{"api_key":"YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"}' \
    --region us-east-1
```

## **Step 3: Create an IAM role or user**

In the search bar type "IAM" 

Click Roles -> Create Role

For the Use Case enter "S3" and click next

Under Add Permission search for AmazonS3FullAccess, MediaConvertFullAccess and AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess and click next

Under Role Details, enter "HighlightProcessorRole" as the name

Select Create Role

Find the role in the list and click on it
Under Trust relationships
Edit the trust policy to this:
Edit the Trust Policy and replace it with this:
```bash
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": [
          "ec2.amazonaws.com",
          "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com",
          "mediaconvert.amazonaws.com"
        ],
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<"your-account-id">:user/<"your-iam-user">"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

## **Step 4: Update .env file**
1. RapidAPI_KEY: Ensure that you have successfully created the account and select "Subscribe To Test" in the top left of the Sports Highlights API
2. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id_here
3. AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key_here
4. S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_S3_bucket_name_here
5. MEDIACONVERT_ENDPOINT=https://your_mediaconvert_endpoint_here.amazonaws.com
```bash
aws mediaconvert describe-endpoints
```
7. MEDIACONVERT_ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::your_account_id:role/HighlightProcessorRole

## **Step 5: Secure .env file**
```bash
chmod 600 .env
```
## **Step 6: Locally Buikd & Run The Docker Container**
Run:
```bash
docker build -t highlight-processor .
```

Run the Docker Container Locally:
```bash
docker run --env-file .env highlight-processor
```
           
This will run fetch.py, process_one_video.py and mediaconvert_process.py and the following files should be saved in your S3 bucket:

Optional - Confirm there is a video uploaded to s3://<your-bucket-name>/videos/first_video.mp4

Optional - Confirm there is a video uploaded to s3://<your-bucket-name>/processed_videos/

### **What We Learned**
1. Working with Docker and AWS Services
2. Identity Access Management (IAM) and least privilege
3. How to enhance media quality 

### **Future Enhancements**
1. Using Terraform to enhance the Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
2. Increasing the amount of videos process and converted with AWS Media Convert
3. Change the date from static (specific point in time) to dyanmic (now, last 30 days from today's date,etc)

# Part 2 - Terraform Bonus

### **Setup terraform.tfvars File**
1. In the github repo, there is a resources folder and copy the entire contents
2. In the AWS Cloudshell or vs code terminal, create the file vpc_setup.sh and paste the script inside.
3. Run the script
```bash
bash vpc_setup.sh
```
4. You will see variables in the output, paste these variables into lines 8-13.
5. Store your API key in AWS Secrets Manager
```bash
aws ssm put-parameter \
  --name "/myproject/rapidapi_key" \
  --value "YOUR_SECRET_KEY" \
  --type SecureString
```
6.  Run the following script to obtain your mediaconvert_endpoint:
```bash
aws mediaconvert describe-endpoints
```
7. Leave the mediaconvert_role_arn string empty

Helpful Tip for Beginners:
1. Use the same region, project, S3 Bucketname and ECR Repo name to make following along easier. Certain steps like pushing the docker image to the ECR repo is easier to copy and paste without remember what you named your repo :)

### **Run The Project**
1.  Navigate to the terraform folder/workspace in VS Code
From the src folder
```bash
cd terraform
```
2. Initialize terraform working directory
```bash
terraform init
```
3. Check syntax and validity of your Terraform configuration files
```bash
terraform validate
```
4. Display execution plan for the terraform configuration
```bash
terraform plan
```
5. Apply changes to the desired state
```bash
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.dev.tfvars"
```
6.Build the docker image for AWS deployment - ensure you are at the src folder 
```bash
docker build -t highlight-pipeline:latest .
docker tag highlight-pipeline:latest <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/highlight-pipeline:latest
```
7.Log into ECR & Push
```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | \
  docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

docker push <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/highlight-pipeline:latest
```

### **Destroy ECS and ECR resources**
1. In the AWS Cloudshell or vs code terminal, create the file ncaaprojectcleanup.sh and paste the script inside from the resources folder.
3. Run the script
```bash
bash ncaaprojectcleanup.sh
```
### **Review Video Files**
1. Navigate to the S3 Bucket and confirm there is a json video in the highlights folder and a video in the videos folder

### **What We Learned**
1. Deploying local docker images to ECR 
2. A high level overview of terraform files
3. Networking - VPCs, Internet Gateways, private subnets and public subnets
4. SSM for saving secrets and pulling into terraform

### **Future Enhancements**
1. Automating the creation of VPCs/networking infra, media endpoint
